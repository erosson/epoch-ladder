# [Epoch-Rank](https://epoch-rank.erosson.org)

An alternative view of [Last Epoch's ladder](https://lastepoch.com/ladder) highlighting class and skill popularity.

Inspired by [poe.ninja/builds](https://poe.ninja/challengessf/builds), though with no online armory (yet?), this isn't nearly as good.

### Secrets

- Last Epoch's official ladder doesn't show character death counts, but their API has them!
- [?rank=level](https://epoch-rank.erosson.org?rank=level) shows a leaderboard sorted by character level, including characters who've never visited the arena. This isn't visible on [Last Epoch's official ladder](https://lastepoch.com/ladder), but their API supports it! Unsure how EHG feels about making this widely available, so Epoch-Rank keeps it lightly hidden.
- [?enableExp=1](https://epoch-rank.erosson.org?enableExp=1) shows each character's experience - data that's once again in the API but not shown on the official ladder. It doesn't appear to match what I see in-game and I don't think I got exp-per-level right in the exp bars, so it's hidden by default - but feel free to try it out.
